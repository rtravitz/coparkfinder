Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area,307 W. Sackett Ave.,Salida,81201,ahra@state.co.us,"\""We are the river.\"" That\'s the catchphrase for fun and adventure in this recreation area along one of the most popular whitewater boating rivers in the United States that also features the longest continuous stretch of Gold Medal water in Colorado. In spring and summer, river lovers can bring their own craft or float with a professional outfitter, following 152 miles of the mild-to-wild Arkansas River, from Leadville to Lake Pueblo. A range of challenging levels awaits whitewater rafters, canoeists, kayakers and stand-up paddleboarders, from Class II and III for beginner and family trips, to roaring Class IV and V rapids for the adventure-minded. Check the website for a list of licensed outfitters and boating companies. For those more interested in recreation on land, there\'s plenty to do along the river\'s winding course. Walk & wade anglers can try their luck in the Gold Medal waters. Others might want to pan for gold at the river\'s edge, rock climb in steepwalled canyons, picnic or watch wildlife along the river and amid the gentle valleys and high mountains. There are eight campgrounds and numerous recreation sites along the river providing a variety of trails that can be utilized to access the river or provide an opportunity to view wildlife. Summer weekends can be very busy on the river, so try a weekday visit if possible. Because river conditions continually change, visitors should check the park\'s website prior to visiting",http://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/Parks/ArkansasHeadwatersRecreationArea,"visitor center, boat ramps, basic campsites, group campground, group picnic area, picnic sites","biking, boating, cross-country skiing/snowshoeing, fishing, geocaching, hiking, horseback trails, hunting, ice fishing, ice skating, OHV riding, ranger/nature programs, rock climbing, swimming, wildlife/bird viewing, winter camping"
Barr Lake State Park,13401 Picadilly Road,Brighton,80603,barr.lake@state.co.us,"Birds. They\'re the headliners at Barr Lake, a mecca for birdwatchers from throughout the West. More than 370 species have been sighted here and records date back to the 1880s. Visitors can see bird banding in action at the migration-season banding station. Many bald eagles spend winter in the area and one pair regularly nests here in summer, raising young in a tree at the water\'s edge. A visit might start with a stop at the nature center and a talk with a naturalist. Circling the lake on the level 8.8-mile, multi-use trail, much of it through a designated wildlife refuge, is a good way to see the park, particularly by bicycle or horseback. Several wildlife-viewing stations interpret the park\'s wildlife and offer good places to stop and watch for birds, deer, coyotes and other wildlife, both on water and on land. This 1,900-acre prairie reservoir on the northeast side of Denver makes a great family fishing adventure or weekend picnic spot. Anglers can catch channel catfish, small and largemouth bass, rainbow trout, walleye, bluegill, wiper and tiger muskie in the lake. Kayakers and canoeists particularly enjoy the calm waters because boat motors are limited to 10 horsepower. The archery range\„free with park entrance\„is another fun activity. The archery range features 12 lanes from 10-60 yards. Classes on basic archery are occasionally offered. A 3D walking archery range will be opening in spring 2015.",http://cpw.state.co.us/placestogo/parks/BarrLake,"nature center, archery range, boat ramps, group picnic area, picnic sites","biking, cross-country skiing/snowshoeing, boating: motorized and nonmotorized, fishing, geocaching, hiking, horseback trails, hunting, ice fishing, ranger/nature programs, sail/ paddle sports, wildlife/bird viewing"
Boyd Lake,3720 North County Road 11-C,Loveland,80538,boyd.lake@state.co.us,"Colorful sailboats skimming blue water. Ski boats and jet skis cutting the waves. Canoes paddling the lake edge. All against a stunning mountain backdrop. That\'s the scene at Boyd Lake, a 1,747-acre watersports haven lying between the plains and the mountains at the very foot of snow-capped Longs Peak. Power zones for water skiing, wakeboarding, and riding personal watercraft; and no-wake zones for paddle sports, fishing and floating, offer an enjoyable boating experience for all types of users.
