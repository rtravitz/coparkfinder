Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area,307 W. Sackett Ave.,Salida,81201,ahra@state.co.us,"""We are the river."" That's the catchphrase for fun and adventure in this recreation area along one of the most popular whitewater boating rivers in the United States that also features the longest continuous stretch of Gold Medal water in Colorado. In spring and summer, river lovers can bring their own craft or float with a professional outfitter, following 152 miles of the mild-to-wild Arkansas River, from Leadville to Lake Pueblo. A range of challenging levels awaits whitewater rafters, canoeists, kayakers and stand-up paddleboarders, from Class II and III for beginner and family trips, to roaring Class IV and V rapids for the adventure-minded. Check the website for a list of licensed outfitters and boating companies. For those more interested in recreation on land, there's plenty to do along the river's winding course. Walk & wade anglers can try their luck in the Gold Medal waters. Others might want to pan for gold at the river's edge, rock climb in steepwalled canyons, picnic or watch wildlife along the river and amid the gentle valleys and high mountains. There are eight campgrounds and numerous recreation sites along the river providing a variety of trails that can be utilized to access the river or provide an opportunity to view wildlife. Summer weekends can be very busy on the river, so try a weekday visit if possible.
